### Dev workflow


- Create a branch
`git checkout -b <your-branch-name>`

- View and add your changes
`git status`
`git add .` to add all files
`git add <filename>` to add a specific file

- Commit your changes
`git commit -m'<insert your commit message here>'`

- Push your changes. If you the origin is not set as your upstream, follow the prompt after git push
`git push`

- Create a pull request into the main branch so that we can review and comment on it
