### Dev workflow
Don't commit directly to the main branch. This can cause conflicts and confusions. Instead, we will make feature branches and make pull requests to merge them into the main branch. 
- Create a branch
`git checkout -b <your-branch-name>`

- View and add your changes
`git status`
`git add .` to add all files
`git add <filename>` to add a specific file

- Commit your changes
`git commit -m'<insert your commit message here>'`

- Push your changes. If you the origin is not set as your upstream, follow the prompt after git push
`git push`

- Create a pull request into the main branch so that we can review and comment on it
